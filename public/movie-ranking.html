<h1>Favorite Movies List: All Time Stars</h1>
<h2>Here's a list of my most liked movies that I watched over years.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>As the IMDB score shows, this movie never ages and keeps on chnaging the way people think and force you to reconsider what you think is the truth.It's definitely a must see.</p>
<h3>2. Truman Show</h3>
<p>This show also makes you question about the reality you believe in, and it shows how hard it is to trust people around you, while leaving you alone with some existential crisis! It's fun, nice yet simultaniously hardbreaking.</p>
<h3>3. The Matrix</h3>
<p>The world we live in today evolves in favour of automatized moves and sectors. With that on the rise we sometimes forget or get too busy for 
the things we used to care about as people. We stopped wondering most things and started doing more what's said by someone else.
 But how do we make sure that's right and how do we know that someone is our friend? One way to find out.</p>
